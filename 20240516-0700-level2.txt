Switzerland won a big singing contest called Eurovision. Nemo became the first nonbinary singer to win the contest.

They won with their song 'The Code'. This song mixes different kinds of music and talks about Nemo's story of finding out who they are. Although there were protests against Israel's attack on Gaza during the contest, when Switzerland won Nemo was proud. They said that it was important for people like them to be in the contest.

A Dutch journalist said that Switzerland deserved to win. But people were upset because a singer from the Netherlands got kicked out of the contest before it finished.
