2024-04-26 15:00 Asia's nuclear waste dams - level 2

In Central Asia, there are dams which hold uranium mine waste. After a 2017 landslide, the area became unstable. There is a risk that these dams could collapse. There are often earthquakes in this area, which worries scientists.

If these dams collapse, it could lead to a big disaster similar to Chernobyl. This disaster would affect water which farmers use for their fields. It would have an impact on 16 million people in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, who depend on farming.

European experts suggest moving the waste away from the Mailuu-Suu River. They estimate that it would cost 22-25 million euros to do it. But it is necessary to prevent a big catastrophe.
