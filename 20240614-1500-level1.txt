Far-right parties get more votes in the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany. But the center-right European People's Party (EPP) is still the biggest in the European Parliament.

Ursula von der Leyen is the leader of this party. She wants another term. She promised to stop extreme ideas in Europe. But she may need to work with the far-right parties. The EPP includes Germany's Christian Democrats and Spain's People's Party.

But voters are moving away from Green parties and towards the far-right Identity and Democracy Group. This group includes more extreme parties. Some of these parties do not like the EU.
