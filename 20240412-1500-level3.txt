2024-04-12 15:00 Slovakia has a new president - level 3

The victory of Social Democrat Peter Pellegrini in Slovakia’s presidential election has strengthened the ruling party led by Robert Fico.

Fico’s party is seen as eurosceptic and aligned with Russian narratives, and it’ll now have both the government and the president from the same political spectrum. Pellegrini’s campaign focused on promising stability for the government if elected, as he is a key coalition leader. He pledged not to hinder the government’s agenda. His opponent Ivan Korčok accused Pellegrini of risking Slovakia’s involvement in the war by supporting Ukraine. However, Pellegrini hasn’t yet clearly defined his stance on various issues. Pellegrini expresses pro-European sentiments, but he also emphasizes protecting Slovakian interests.

Pellegrini’s win with 54% of the vote raises concerns about Slovakia’s future alignment with populist trends, similar to Hungary under Viktor Orbán.
