2024-05-16 07:00 Switzerland wins the Eurovision Song Contest - level 3

Switzerland won the Eurovision Song Contest, with Nemo, the first nonbinary contestant, claiming the crystal microphone.

Their song 'The Code' blends various genres like drum-and-bass, opera, rap, and rock, and it narrates Nemo's journey of self-discovery as a nonbinary person. Despite protests against Israel's actions in Gaza, Switzerland's victory stood out. Nemo expressed pride, highlighted the importance of queer representation in Eurovision and the impact of their song on others. Dutch journalist Frank van Dijk praised Switzerland's win as deserved and highlighted the contest's shift toward rewarding quality songs and staging.

Additionally, the disqualification of Dutch singer Yus Klein before the final sparked anger, and many deemed it disproportionate.
