2024-06-14 15:00 The EU after the election - level 2

Far-right parties got more votes in the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany, but the center-right European People's Party (EPP) will still be the largest in the European Parliament.

This is the party of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who wants another term. She promised to protect against extreme views but didn't rule out working with the hard right during her campaign.

The EPP will remain the largest group, including Germany's Christian Democrats and Spain's People's Party. But voters are moving away from Green parties and towards the far-right Identity and Democracy Group. This group includes more extreme parties, many of whom don't like the EU.
