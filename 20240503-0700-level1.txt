2024-05-03 07:00 Political polls - level 1

Polls tell us what people think. Political polls before elections tell us who could be the winner.

But TV polls sometimes get things wrong. In 2016 and 2020, they say that more Americans will vote for Democrats. But that does not happen. Guessing the future is hard. Good polls want to understand people, not only guess. Sometimes it is not clear where the information comes from. Since 2016, polls are different. More polls are online. But some people cannot do these polls, for example in places without good internet.

Polls are not always accurate. But they are important. They tell us what people think.
