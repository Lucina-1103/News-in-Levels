2024-04-19 15:00 Animal sanctuaries have problems - level 3

A recent survey revealed that animal sanctuaries across the United States are facing challenges due to inflation and decreased donations.

The survey found that most of the 45 sanctuaries reported high prices for essentials like hay and grain since the pandemic. Over a third of them experienced costs doubling. The Catskill Sanctuary is home to 200 rescued animals. They highlighted the significant rise in expenses for essential supplies and medical care. Simultaneously, donations have declined across all levels, from modest to substantial contributions.

Founder Kathy Stevens expressed concern that if sanctuaries continue closing down, many animals could face starvation or slaughter. There's been a drop in the yearly rise of consumer prices however, many sanctuaries are still struggling to survive.
