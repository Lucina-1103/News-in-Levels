2024-04-26 15:00 Asia's nuclear waste dams - level 1

In Central Asia, there are dams full of dangerous waste. This waste comes from uranium mines.

In 2017, there is an earthquake. The area is not stable anymore. The dams may break. If it happens, it will be a disaster as big as Chernobyl. Rivers are near the dams. Millions of people use water from these rivers. Farmers need it for their fields. A disaster would hurt Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. 16 million people live there.

European experts want to move the waste away. It will cost 22-25 million euros.
