Slovakia has a new president. Peter Pellegrini wins the election.

Pellegrini has similar ideas to Robert Fico. Fico is Slovakia’s Prime Minister. He is skeptical about the EU. He likes Russian ideas more. Now, both the president and the government have the same ideas. Some people believe that it is good for the country. Ivan Kročok is the other candidate for president. He is afraid that Slovakia will take part in war with Russia.

Pellegrini says that he agrees with the EU. But Slovakia and its people are more important. Some people worry that Slovakia will be more populist, just like Hungary.
