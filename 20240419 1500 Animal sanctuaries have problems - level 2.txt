2024-04-19 15:00 Animal sanctuaries have problems - level 2

Animal sanctuaries in the United States are facing tough times. There are two reasons for that, rising prices and fewer donations.

Most of the 45 sanctuaries in the US reported high prices for essentials like hay and grain since the pandemic. For over a third of them, costs doubled. The Catskill Sanctuary is home to 200 rescued animals. They reported a big increase in the cost of food and medical care. At the same time, donations decreased.

Founder Kathy Stevens worries that if sanctuaries continue closing down, many animals could die from hunger. It may be necessary to kill them.
