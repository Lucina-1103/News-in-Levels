2024-04-19 15:00 Animal sanctuaries have problems - level 1

An animal sanctuary is a place where animals live. People rescue these animals. Animals are safe here.

Animal sanctuaries in the United States are having problems. Mostof the 45 sanctuaries have to pay more for things like hay and grain. Prices go up a lot of after the pandemic. Prices of some things double. The Catskill Sanctuary has 200 animals. It also has to pay more for things like hay and grain. Medicine is expensive, too.

At some time, fewer people give money to animal sanctuaries. This is bad news. Animal sanctuaries need maney from people. If sanctuaries close, many animals will not have food.

The victory of Social Democrat Peter Pellegrini in Slovakia’s presidential election has strengthened the ruling party led by Robert Fico.

Fico’s party is seen as eurosceptic and aligned with Russian narratives, and it’ll now have both the government and the president from the same political spectrum. Pellegrini’s campaign focused on promising stability for the government if elected, as he is a key coalition leader. He pledged not to hinder the government’s agenda. His opponent Ivan Korčok accused Pellegrini of risking Slovakia’s involvement in the war by supporting Ukraine. However, Pellegrini hasn’t yet clearly defined his stance on various issues. Pellegrini expresses pro-European sentiments, but he also emphasizes protecting Slovakian interests.

Pellegrini’s win with 54% of the vote raises concerns about Slovakia’s future alignment with populist trends, similar to Hungary under Viktor Orbán.
