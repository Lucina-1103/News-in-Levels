An animal sanctuary is a place where animals live. People rescue these animals. Animals are safe here.

Animal sanctuaries in the United States are having problems. Mostof the 45 sanctuaries have to pay more for things like hay and grain. Prices go up a lot of after the pandemic. Prices of some things double. The Catskill Sanctuary has 200 animals. It also has to pay more for things like hay and grain. Medicine is expensive, too.

At some time, fewer people give money to animal sanctuaries. This is bad news. Animal sanctuaries need maney from people. If sanctuaries close, many animals will not have food.
