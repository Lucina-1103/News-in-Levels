Despite the far right gaining power in the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany, the center-right European People's Party (EPP) is likely to stay the biggest party in the European Parliament.

This party is led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who wants a second term. She promised to protect against political extremes; however, she didn't rule out working with the hard right, like Italy's Georgia Meloni, during her campaign.

After all votes were counted, the future makeup of the European Parliament became clearer. The EPP will probably remain the largest group, including Germany's Christian Democrats and Spain's People's Party. However, there are big changes at the extremes, with voters turning away from Green parties and towards the far-right Identity and Democracy Group. This group includes nationalist and populist parties, many of whom are critical of the EU. Recently, they expelled Germany's far-right AfD party due to scandals.
