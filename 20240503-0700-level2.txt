Polls try to show and help understand what people think, especially during elections. But sometimes they are not right, because it is hard to guess the future.

Polls on TV sometimes get things wrong. In 2016 and 2020, they said that more Americans would vote for Democrats than actually did. Good pools try to understand people and their opinions, rather than just guess who will win. Small differences in polls arenâ€™t always important, but polling methods must be transparent. It must be clear how they got their information.

Polls changed since 2016. There are more online polls, but there are problems like no response or bad internet access in villages. Although is it not easy to guess the result, polls are still important for understanding what people think.
