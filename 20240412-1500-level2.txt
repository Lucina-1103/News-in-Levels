2024-04-12 15:00 Slovakia has a new president - level 2

Peter Pellegrini became Slovakia's new president, which supported Robert Fico's ruling party.

Fico's party is skeptical towards the EU and it prefers Russian views. Now, both the government and the president are from the same political spectrum, and many people believe that it will make the country stable. Pellegrini promised to support the government. His opponent Ivan Korčok criticized Pellegrini. Kročok said that Slovakia could get involved in in war with Russia. For some people, Pellegrini's political ideas are not clear. He agrees with the EU but at the same time, he wants to protect Slovakian interests.

Some people worry that Slovakia will follow the same path as Hungary.
